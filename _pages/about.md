I am a $2^{nd}$ year masters student at Lakehead University.

I completed my bachelors in Computer Engineering from [Gujarat Technological University](https://www.gtu.ac.in/) in 2018. My undergraduate projects was titled **Detection and Recognition System** and Recognition of object was achieved by keeping that object in front of the frame of camera by using the Local Binary Pattern
Histogram algorithm.

I am also interested in ML(Machine Learning), DL(Deep Learning) and NLP(Natural Language Processing). I have made some cool projects on these topic which can be found in Projects Section.

I have keen interest in Software Engineering. I have made couple of projects in React, Django and in Flasks. Those can be found on Github, Links and Projects discreption can be found in Projects section. Currently learning about MERN(Mongo-db, Express, React, Node-js) stack.

Competitive Programming is one of my hobbies. I am just a beginner and am trying to improve. Here are my [codechef](https://www.codechef.com/users/kp_2141) and [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/kp2141krp) profiles. I also solve problems from codeforces website. 


I do have reading-hobby. I particularily read about Personality developments, Finance, non-Fictions and some novels. I also love reading about Data Structures and Algorithms, Programming Languages, ML, DL, NLP and some other technologies.
